# Emacs Config

# Installation
Backup your current emacs configuration directory. Afterwards run:
```
git clone git@github.com:w8ste/emacs.git ~/.config/emacs
```

Then open a new emacs instance (not client) and run the following commands with `M-x`:
```
pdf-tools-install
```

# Dependencies 
- It is required to have a GUI application set as a pinentry program if you want to be able to sign commits from within emacs. Or atleast i did not get a tty version to work for me, this is probably a skill issue, altough utilizing a program like `pinentry-gtk2`

Using emacs because Dr. Kord Eikmeyer advocates for it.
